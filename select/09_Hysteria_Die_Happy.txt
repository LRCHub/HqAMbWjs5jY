It's ticking in my head
When you try to explain what love is
It's getting on my nerves
When you make a lame excuse

Every single minute with you
Feels like hours
Still, I just can't seem to leave

I know you for sure

Hysteria - is rising in my vains
Hysteria - you're making me insane
I'm serious
I'll shut your mouth for good

It's ticking in my head
When you put your "I know better" face on
I don't give a damn
If you hide behind a smile

Can't believe you did it
And still your head is higher
I don't wanna know what's going on
When you sleep

I know you for sure

Hysteria - is rising in my vains
Hysteria - you're making me insane
I'm serious
I'll shut your mouth for good

Going down I'm waiting for tomorrow
Hardest surface digging under
Should I be really waiting for tomorrow
No more reasons to go on

Hysteria - is rising in my vains
Hysteria - you're making me insane
I'm serious
I'll shut your mouth for good
