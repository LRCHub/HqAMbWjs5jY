Ooops, alright, I'll come over
And pour myself over you
Jars of fun, exciting stories
I'll make you forget

Tickle you a little bit
Seduce out your good temper
I'll shine all over
I'll cook my best dish for you
But then it's my turn

I want all your adoration
Dog, I own you
Sit down fool, you own me
I'm yours, I'm the sun
I'll shine all over you
Grab the rays, sugar

Ooops, alright, I'll come over
And pour myself over you
Jars of fun, exciting stories
I'll make you forget, I'll make you forget

Tickle you a little bit
Seduce out your good temper
I'll shine all over
I'll cook my best dish for you

Tickle you a little bit
Seduce out your good temper
I'll shine all over
I'll cook my best dish for you

Tickle you a little bit
Seduce out your good temper
I'll shine all over
I'll cook my best dish for you

I want all your adoration
I need you
I'm the sun
I'll, I'll shine all over
I'll make you forget

Grab the rays, sugar
Come on back now
I'll be your sun
I'll shine
