See this is the Black
See this is the Black Mass
See this is the Black Mass Hysteria
I'm coming out into your vein loving my soul
And so you wait I'm coming down
When other vow
I see you alive until your sons
They're mourning for my crown
And mirror say that love was found
And I own you black Mass Hysteria
Black Mass Hysteria
I'm coming out and see your vein
I'm coming down myself
But let it down and see you waste
The time I own
I'm feeling out, the time has come
The devil in my thought
We are livings of this dome and I own you
Now you're feeling out myself
That feeling know i'm coming now
I tell you to feel my soul
Black Mass Hysteria black Mass Hysteria
Black Mass Hysteria black Mass Hysteria
See it's just a black
See it's just a black mass
See it's just a Black Mass Hysteria
Black Mass Hysteria black Mass Hysteria
Black Mass Hysteria black Mass Hysteria
Black Mass Hysteria
